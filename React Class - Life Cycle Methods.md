Life Cycle Methods

In React Class Component, there are three major life cycle methods that gets triggerred in different phases
The three methods are componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate and componentWillUnmount
These methods are triggered at different phases of a component
The phases of a component are mounting phase, updation phase and finally unmounting phase

Mounting Phase

This is the phase where the component is loaded for the first time to the DOM
During this phase, first the constructor gets invoked if there is a constructor.
Constructors are invoked first so as to initialise the states and props that are required for the Component
Soon after that the render method is triggered
This method is responsible for returning JSX
JSX is then transpiled to React Elements in-order to form the React Tree other wise known as the Virtual DOM
Soon after the render method is invoked the first life cycle method componentDidMount gets invoked
This method will only be called once and that would just be in the mounting phase
This method can majorly be used to make asyncronous calls

Updation Phase

This is the phase where the component gets updated due to change in props or state.
Change in state can happen by using this.setState
Change in props can happen if the props where it is send from is getting updated.
During this phase, componentDidUpdate gets triggered
This method will be triggered the number of times the state or props are changed.
This method recieves two parameters prevProps and prevState.
These parameters can be mainly used for comparison purposes

Unmounting Phase

This is the phase where the component is getting removed from the DOM
During this phase componentWillUnmount is triggered.
This life cycle is mainly used for clean-up purpose as well reseting states.
Usage of Life Cycle Method
class App extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props)
    this.state = {
      name: 'Crio'
    }
  }
  handleUpdateName = () => {
    this.setState({name: 'Ajo'})
  }
  componentDidMount() {
    console.log('Mounting Phase')
    this.handleUpdateName()
  }
  componentDidUpdate(prevProps,prevState) {
    console.log('Updating Phase',prevProps,prevState);
  }
  componentWillUnmount() {
    console.log('Unmounting Phase')
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <p>Name: {this.state.name}</p>
    )
  }
}
